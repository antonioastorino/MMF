# Make Makefile
As I like writing from scratch whatever I can, I am creating a simple shell script that generates a `Makefile` file for C/C++ (also hybrid) projects.

#### Please read carefully this document before using the tools provided here.

### Description
This project mainly consists of a single script called `makeMakefile.sh`. This script can placed in any folder of your C/C++ project. Once run, the script will look for all the `.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, and `.hpp` files in the paths specified in the script itself. Based on those files, the script will create and populate the `Makefile` file which you can use to compile your project. Hence, make sure you don't have multiple projects in the specified paths.

### Directory structure
The `Makefile` generated by `makeMakefile` will create the following files and folders:

1. `build_folder`, by default `../build`
2. `search_path`, by default `./ ../include ../src` containing all project files
3. `executable_folder`, by default `./`, which is where the final executable is placed

Those parameters are set towards the beginning of `makeMakefile` and you can freely modify the following parameters. However, the path assigned to `build_folder` can be delete by `./makeMakefile` or the resulting `Makefile`. Therefore, **CHOOSE A FOLDER THAT CAN BE COMPLETELY DELETED AS A BUILD FOLDER!**

## Instructions
You can choose to

* clone/download this repository for a complete C/C++ project example or
* download only `makeMakefile.sh` and place it in the root folder of the project you want to compile. 

Then run

```
cd MMF/make-folder
./makeMakefile.sh                      # create the `Makefile` file in ./
make SHELL=/bin/bash OPT=[<OPT_LEVEL>] # compile your (or the downloaded) project with optimization level <OPT_LEVEL>
./prj-out-<OPT_LEVEL>                  # execute the compiled program
```
Done!

Here, `<OPT_LEVEL>` indicates the **optimization level** you can optionally choose for compiling the project. Note that `<OPT_LEVEL>` is `0` by default, namely if not specified when you run `make`. The accepted values for it are `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3`. The compiled executable is named accordingly.

To cleanup, run

```
make clean         # delete the specified build folder and the 
```
